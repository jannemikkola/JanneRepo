## Welcome to My GitHub Page

This is my Github page. This page is for the course: "Scientific Computing Infrastructures". Code from the course will be posted here to ensure a functional version control system.

### Previous Projects

I don't have access to very many of my earlier projects, but below are generally listed some of the works I have participated in.

```markdown

- Various Unity Engine Projects
- Interactive Flash Animation Projects
- MC plugins
- Cryptocurrency trading algorithms (C Sharp)
```

List to be updated with working links and examples when possible.

### Page Under Construction

This page will be updated as the project moves forward. For now it looks pretty empty.
